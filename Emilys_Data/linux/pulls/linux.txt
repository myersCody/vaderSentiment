funny :) 

At least fix that typo, "I love Linus Torvalds".

See definition of nouveau_grctx above, ctx->data is simply a pointer of ctxprog array.

ocal_irq_save(flags);  --> should be "local_irq_save(flags);"?
Is it a spelling wrong?

Someone necessarily lend a hand to make critically posts I might state. That is the first time I frequented your website page and thus far? I amazed with the analysis you made to make this actual put up extraordinary. Fantastic task!

Liunx o.O

This line is basically proof this is a joke :P

@torvalds, awaiting your opinion on this

Software Rights!

'There is no objective way to determine whether one person's code is better than another's.'

Seriously?

kidding me?

There is no objective way to determine whether one person's code is better than another's. In light of this fact, all submitted code will be equally accepted.  However, marginalized groups, such as wom*n and trans* will be given priority in order to make up for past discrimination.  Simply submit a pull request for any submission, whether code, artwork, or even irrelevant bits — nothing is irrelevant in the grand struggle for a Truly Tolerant UNIX-ike Kernel!

I'm assuming garbage collection - a process viewed as a masculine job by the patriarchy - will now also come to an end.

Gps locate

I take offence at this.

This is a huge joke.

hah github made me redact the 'rm -rf yourself' commentary

"No coding experience is necessary." Oh, so now we are submitting crappy code to the OS that, oh, 60% of the world's servers use?

I thought this couldn't get any better and then I read this

I'm done with this.

these rights are making me uncomfortable

just look at them as writes instead

> feminists are trying to eliminate linus

k

Missing the further documentation. Also, Linus doesn't accept PRs on Github.
@Propheis thx
don't use Chinese , change to English please.
pls test  on Dell Lattitude E5570.
thanks


pls add tests
indentation issue

Yes, that's true o_O

However, seems like pull requests are not accepted from github anyway.
It's the first time I tried to contribute something to the linux kernel, sorry :)
Spaces instead of tabs... well... Never trust vim ^^
I think this line should be kept for performance reasons.
Could be minified a bit more. I suggest compiling this line using [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten
), passing the output to [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) for maximum performance.
Don't forget the comments 👍
Remove the comment as it takes up unnecessary room
Remove this too
You forgot to define every datatype. you could do this:

#define c = char 

etc.

This way, you can optimize EVEN MORE!
HE FORGOT TO REMOVE THE COMMENTS!
You want to make crazy to Linus 
why change while
I've only ever heard of minification in JavaScript.  Does this truly make the code better?
js style ;) Maybe this guy is angular expert?))))
good
